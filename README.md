The company Visual Geometry Group created VGGNet (by Oxford University). While GoogLeNet won the classification assignment at ILSVR2014, this architecture came first. Understanding VGGNet is important since many contemporary image classification models are constructed on top of it.
What is VGG-Net?
It is a typical deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) design with numerous layers, and the abbreviation VGG stands for Visual Geometry Group. The term “deep” describes the number of layers, with VGG-16 or VGG-19 having 16 or 19 convolutional layers, respectively.

Innovative object identification models are built using the VGG architecture. The VGGNet, created as a deep neural network, outperforms benchmarks on a variety of tasks and datasets outside of ImageNet. It also remains one of the most often used image recognition architectures today.
